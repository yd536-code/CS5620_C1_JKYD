# Forking & Syncing a Repo

Directions for forking an assignment repo and keeping it properly synced.

## 1. Fork the Repo

Click the fork button in the upper right corner of the assignment repo.

## 2. Create a Local Clone of your Fork

Navigate to your newly forked repo, and clone the fork as you normally would by clicking on the green "Code" button and
selecting your preferred method of cloning.

## 3. Configure Git to Sync your fork

1. Navigate to the location of your local clone of the fork
2. Type `git remote -v` You should see the current configured remote repository for your fork which will look something
   like this:

```
$ git remote -v
> origin  https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/C1-Intro-To-Graphics-F2026.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/C1-Intro-To-Graphics-F2026.git (push)
```

3. Type `$ git remote add upstream https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/Intro-To-Graphics-F2026/C1-Intro-To-Graphics-F2026.git`
   Do double check that the URL which
   follows `upstream` is the URL you would copy when cloning the **original** assignment repo.
4. To verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork, type `git remote -v` again. You should see the
   URL for your fork as `origin`, and the URL for the original repository as `upstream`. It will look something like
   this:

```
$ git remote -v
> origin    https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/C1-Intro-To-Graphics-F2026.git (fetch)
> origin    https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/C1-Intro-To-Graphics-F2026.git (push)
> upstream  https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/Intro-To-Graphics-F2026/C1-Intro-To-Graphics-F2026.git (fetch)
> upstream  https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/Intro-To-Graphics-F2026/C1-Intro-To-Graphics-F2026.git (push)
```

## 4. Syncing your Fork

If there are changes to the original repository, you will want to sync your fork with this repo by following these
steps:

1. Navigate to the location of your local clone of the fork
2. Type `git fetch upstream` which will fetch the new commits from the upstream repository
3. Type `git checkout main` to ensure you are on the main branch of your local repo
4. Type `git merge upstream/main` to merge any changes from the original assignment repo into your local fork

## 5. Push your Changes (Optional)

Syncing your fork only updates your local copy of the repository. If you want to update your fork on GitHub make sure to
push your changes!
